            <p class="maintext">The PPLingo website (“Website”) and mobile application (“App”) and related services
                (together with the Website, the “Service”), including our language proficiency testing services (the
                “PPLingo ”) are operated by PPLingo Pte Ltd. (“PPLingo,” “us,” or “we”). Access and use of the Service
                is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms and Conditions”). By accessing or
                using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
                these Terms and Conditions including any future modifications. PPLingo may amend, update or change these
                Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and
                Conditions on the Website for at least 7 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the
                bottom of the Terms and Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms
                and Conditions will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first
                time you access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms and

            <p class="wensitetitle">Description of Website and Service</p>
            <p class="maintext">The Service allows users to (i) learn or practice a language while they translate
                content from the Web and elsewhere, (ii) submit material for translation by other users, and in some
                cases (iii) in some cases submit translated language courses or new language courses, and, when properly
                registered, (iv) take examinations in the PPLingo . Users interested in learning or practicing a
                language are presented with different types of educational activities; while they perform these
                activities, they also generate valuable data such as translations of Web content. In some cases, the
                content you translate will have been submitted by a customer of PPLingo’s for translation. Your
                translation work will be used in combination with the work of others to complete that translation for
                which PPLingo may receive a fee or other consideration. Users interested in submitting material for
                translation, or submitting translated material or courses, may do so only if they comply with
                requirements set forth in these Terms and Conditions concerning the material submitted and use of the
                translation. Users who register with the PPLingo may take examinations to test their language
                proficiency. PPLingo may, in its sole discretion and at any time, update, change, suspend, make
                improvements to or discontinue any aspect of the Service, temporarily or permanently.</p>

            <p class="warrantiestitle">App License</p>

                non-transferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one copy of the App in object code
                form only on an interactive wireless device that you own or control. You may not derive or attempt to
                derive the source code of all or any portion of the App, permit any third party to derive or attempt to
                derive such source code, or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or translate the App or any part
                thereof. PPLingo and its licensors own and shall retain all intellectual property rights and other
                rights in and to the App, and any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto. The following terms
                and conditions apply to you only if you are using the App from the Apple App Store. To the extent the
                other terms and conditions of these Terms and Conditions are less restrictive than, or otherwise
                conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and
                conditions in this paragraph apply, but solely with respect to Apps from the Apple App Store. You
                acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions are solely between you and PPLingo, not Apple, and
                that Apple has no responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App must comply with
                the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
                maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to
                conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if
                any, for the App to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other
                warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities,
                damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely
                governed by these Terms and Conditions. You and PPLingo acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for
                addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the
                App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to
                conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
                protection or similar legislation. You and PPLingo acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party
                claim that the App or your possession and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual
                property rights, PPLingo, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense,
                settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by

                the App. You and PPLingo acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party
                beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions as they relate to your license of the App, and that, upon
                your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have
                accepted the right) to enforce these Terms and Conditions against you as a third party beneficiary

                with a refund for the affected test, or (b) use reasonable efforts to resolve the Test Issue. For
                purposes of this Section, “Test Issue” means: (i) the inability to complete the test due to a failure in
                the Website or the App, or (ii) Test results are delivered more than 48 hours after the test is
                completed. Whether an issue constitutes a Test Issue will be determined by PPLingo in its reasonable
                discretion. The amount of any refund will depend on the nature of the Test Issue and will not exceed the
                total amount actually paid by the user for the affected test. To submit a valid claim for a refund, a
                user must (a) submit the Test Issue in writing to PPLingo within 24 hours after the Test Issue occurs,
                and respond to PPLingo’s requests for information or cooperation, (b) not have directly or indirectly
                caused the Test Issue, and (c) have met all test requirements when taking the test prior to making a
                claim for a Test Issue.</p>

                meanings set forth in the terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”), located at
                https://www.pplingo.com/legal#terms-of-service. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to
                our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a notice that we
                have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days after the changes are made,
                and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any
                revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of that 7-day period
                or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after any such changes.</p>

            <p class="warrantiestitle">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
            <p class="maintext">When you use PPLingo you provide us with two types of information: (i) information you
                submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service collected by us as you
                interact with the Service.<br />
                When you enter the Website, we collect your browser type and your IP address (a unique address that
                identifies your computer on the Internet). When you use our mobile Application, we collect your device
                type, your device ID, and your IP address. In addition, we store certain information from your browser
                using &#8220;cookies.&#8221; A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user&#8217;s computer tied to
                information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. If you do not
                want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that
                allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary
                to provide you certain features available on the Website (e.g., customized delivery of
                information).<br />
                Through the registration process you may provide us with your name and email address, hometown, and
                other information that may be requested during the registration process. If you register for the PPLingo
                , each time you take a test you must also provide a picture or scan of a current, valid driver’s
                license, passport or other government issued ID and a picture of your face (a “Testing ID”). Your
                Testing ID will be stored for ninety (90) days after validation to help resolve any disputes.<br />
                When you use the Service you may submit information and content to your profile, generate Activity Data
                through engaging in educational activities on the Service, or send messages and otherwise transmit
                information to other users. We store this information so that we can provide you the Service and offer
                personalized features.<br />
                When you use the Service to take an examination in the PPLingo you must provide access to your
                computer’s webcam and microphone. We will use them to record you during the entire examination period
                (“Testing Video”). We store this recording to validate that you took the examination without improper
                assistance. While using the PPLingo you will submit answers to questions and other information as part
                of the testing and evaluation process. We will store that information and use it to evaluate your
                performance on the test, to report results and to evaluate the usefulness, accuracy and other aspects of
                the PPLingo .<br />
                We do not share your personal information with third-parties unless it is necessary to offer the Service
                or required by law (see below for specifics).

        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY PPLINGO</p>
            <p class="maintext">We may use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services
                offered by PPLingo that we think you may find valuable. PPLingo may also send you service-related
                announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out
                of such emails.<br />
                Profile information is used by PPLingo to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the
                Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to supplement your
                profile, including by submitting comments (which can be deleted by you).<br />
                PPLingo may use or share aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity
                Data, for purposes such as understanding or improving the service.<br />
                When you take a test in the PPLingo , PPLingo will use your Testing ID, and other information available
                to PPLingo to validate your actual identity so that we may provide accurate testing results to Score
                Recipients (as defined below). During the test, we will use your PC’s camera and microphone throughout
                the test to collect a Testing Video. Your User Testing ID will be compared to your Testing Video to
                ensure that the person who registered for the examination (and whose identity PPLingo has validated) is
                the same person who took the examination. Testing Video may also be used by our research team for
                examination validation and improvement purposes.

        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">SHARING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</p>
            <p class="maintext">PPLingo shares your personally-identifiable information only when it is reasonably
                necessary to offer the Service, legally required, or permitted by you. For example:<br />
                We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us bring you the
                Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates. In connection
                with these operations, our service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information for
                a limited time. When we utilize service providers for processing any personally-identifiable
                information, we implement reasonable contractual protections limiting the use of that
                personally-identifiable information to the provision of services to PPLingo.<br />
                We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information in response to lawful requests, such
                as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account
                or other personally-identifiable information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to
                protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the
                Service or using the PPLingo name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing
                personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.<br />
                PPLingo will share the complete and accurate results of PPLingo s with such institutions, including
                universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, “Score Recipients”) as you
                specify when you finish an examination. We will never share examination results with any party without
                your direction, except that anonymized examination results may be used by PPLingo and its partners to
                improve the examination and for research and analysis. We will not share your Testing ID with any Score
                Recipients, except with your consent upon initiation of a dispute by a Score Recipient.<br />
                If the ownership of all or substantially all of the PPLingo business, or individual business units or
                assets owned by PPLingo that are related to the Service, were to change, your personally-identifiable
                information may be transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of information, your
                personally-identifiable information would remain subject to this section.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="maintext">You have at all times the right to delete your account with PPLingo by following the
                instructions available through the Service. After your account is deleted we will retain aggregate or
                anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, which may be used by PPLingo and
                shared with third parties in any manner. Information associated with the PPLingo , including examination
                results and your Testing Video, may be collectively deleted from your PPLingo account, but anonymized
                examination data, including your examination results and Testing Video, may be kept indefinitely by
                PPLingo to improve the examination and for research and analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">LINKS</p>
            <p class="maintext">The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy
                practices of other websites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the
                privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. This Privacy
                Policy applies only to information collected by PPLingo via the Service.</p>

        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">INFORMATION SECURITY</p>
            <p class="maintext">PPLingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are
                sufficient to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your Testing ID, User Photo,
                access credentials and PPLingo results. However, we believe that a determined attacker with sufficient
                resources could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the information we seek to
                protect.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="warrantiestitle">DO NOT TRACK</p>
            <p class="maintext">The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.
