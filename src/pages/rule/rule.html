                services (together with the Website, the “Service”), including our language proficiency testing
                services (the “PPLingo ”) are operated by PPLingo Pte Ltd. (“PPLingo,” “us,” or “we”). Access
                and use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms and
                Conditions”). By accessing or using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read,
                understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions including any future
                modifications. PPLingo may amend, update or change these Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we
                will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and Conditions on the Website for at
                least 7 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and
                Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms and Conditions
                will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first time you
                access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms and
                Conditions, you are not authorized to use, access or participate in the Service.

            <p class="wensitetitle">Description of Website and Service</p>
            <p class="maintext">The Service allows users to (i) learn or practice a language while they
                translate content from the Web and elsewhere, (ii) submit material for translation by other
                users, and in some cases (iii) in some cases submit translated language courses or new language
                courses, and, when properly registered, (iv) take examinations in the PPLingo . Users interested
                in learning or practicing a language are presented with different types of educational
                activities; while they perform these activities, they also generate valuable data such as
                translations of Web content. In some cases, the content you translate will have been submitted
                by a customer of PPLingo’s for translation. Your translation work will be used in combination
                with the work of others to complete that translation for which PPLingo may receive a fee or
                other consideration. Users interested in submitting material for translation, or submitting
                translated material or courses, may do so only if they comply with requirements set forth in
                these Terms and Conditions concerning the material submitted and use of the translation. Users
                who register with the PPLingo may take examinations to test their language proficiency. PPLingo
                may, in its sole discretion and at any time, update, change, suspend, make improvements to or
                discontinue any aspect of the Service, temporarily or permanently.

                Subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions, PPLingo grants you a non-transferable,
                non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one copy of the App in object code form only
                on an interactive wireless device that you own or control. You may not derive or attempt to
                derive the source code of all or any portion of the App, permit any third party to derive or
                attempt to derive such source code, or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or translate
                the App or any part thereof. PPLingo and its licensors own and shall retain all intellectual
                property rights and other rights in and to the App, and any changes, modifications, or
                corrections thereto. The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the
                App from the Apple App Store. To the extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms and
                Conditions are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of
                this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph
                apply, but solely with respect to Apps from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and agree that
                these Terms and Conditions are solely between you and PPLingo, not Apple, and that Apple has no
                responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App must comply with the App
                Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
                maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App
                to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase
                price, if any, for the App to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will
                have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims,
                losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any
                warranty will be solely governed by these Terms and Conditions. You and PPLingo acknowledge that
                Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the App
                or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability
                claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
                requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. You and
                PPLingo acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession
                and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, PPLingo, not
                Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of
                any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms and
                Conditions. You must comply with applicable third party terms of agreement when using the App.
                You and PPLingo acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party
                beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions as they relate to your license of the App, and that,
                upon your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be
                deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms and Conditions against you as a third
                party beneficiary thereof. </p>

            <p class="registrationtitle">Refund Policy</p>
            <p class="maintext">
                In the event of a Test Issue, PPLingo will, at its option, either (a) provide the user with a
                refund for the affected test, or (b) use reasonable efforts to resolve the Test Issue. For
                purposes of this Section, “Test Issue” means: (i) the inability to complete the test due to a
                failure in the Website or the App, or (ii) Test results are delivered more than 48 hours after
                the test is completed. Whether an issue constitutes a Test Issue will be determined by PPLingo
                in its reasonable discretion. The amount of any refund will depend on the nature of the Test
                Issue and will not exceed the total amount actually paid by the user for the affected test. To
                submit a valid claim for a refund, a user must (a) submit the Test Issue in writing to PPLingo
                within 24 hours after the Test Issue occurs, and respond to PPLingo’s requests for information
                or cooperation, (b) not have directly or indirectly caused the Test Issue, and (c) have met all
                test requirements when taking the test prior to making a claim for a Test Issue.

            <p class="maintext">
                At PPLingo, we know you care about your personal information, so we have prepared this privacy
                policy (our “Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and share it. By using or accessing
                the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined here
                have the meanings set forth in the terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”), located at
                https://www.pplingo.com/legal#terms-of-service. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect
                changes to our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a
                notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days after
                the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom
                of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective the earlier of
                (i) the end of that 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after any
                such changes.

            <p class="registrationtitle">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
            <p class="maintext">When you use PPLingo you provide us with two types of information: (i)
                information you submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service
                collected by us as you interact with the Service.
                When you enter the Website, we collect your browser type and your IP address (a unique address
                that identifies your computer on the Internet). When you use our mobile Application, we collect
                your device type, your device ID, and your IP address. In addition, we store certain information
                from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
                tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged
                in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple
                procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you
                should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features available on the
                Website (e.g., customized delivery of information).
                Through the registration process you may provide us with your name and email address, hometown,
                and other information that may be requested during the registration process. If you register for
                the PPLingo , each time you take a test you must also provide a picture or scan of a current,
                valid driver’s license, passport or other government issued ID and a picture of your face (a
                “Testing ID”). Your Testing ID will be stored for ninety (90) days after validation to help
                resolve any disputes.
                When you use the Service you may submit information and content to your profile, generate
                Activity Data through engaging in educational activities on the Service, or send messages and
                otherwise transmit information to other users. We store this information so that we can provide
                you the Service and offer personalized features.
                When you use the Service to take an examination in the PPLingo you must provide access to your
                computer’s webcam and microphone. We will use them to record you during the entire examination
                period (“Testing Video”). We store this recording to validate that you took the examination
                without improper assistance. While using the PPLingo you will submit answers to questions and
                other information as part of the testing and evaluation process. We will store that information
                and use it to evaluate your performance on the test, to report results and to evaluate the
                usefulness, accuracy and other aspects of the PPLingo .
                We do not share your personal information with third-parties unless it is necessary to offer the
                Service or required by law (see below for specifics).</p>

            <p class="registrationtitle">USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY PPLINGO</p>
            <p class="maintext">When you use PPLingo you provide us with two types of information: (i)
                information you submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service
                collected by us as you interact with the Service.
                We may use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new services offered by
                PPLingo that we think you may find valuable. PPLingo may also send you service-related
                announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may
                opt out of such emails.
                Profile information is used by PPLingo to be presented back to and edited by you when you access
                the Service and to be presented to other users. In some cases, other users may be able to
                supplement your profile, including by submitting comments (which can be deleted by you).
                PPLingo may use or share aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including
                Activity Data, for purposes such as understanding or improving the service.
                When you take a test in the PPLingo , PPLingo will use your Testing ID, and other information
                available to PPLingo to validate your actual identity so that we may provide accurate testing
                results to Score Recipients (as defined below). During the test, we will use your PC’s camera
                and microphone throughout the test to collect a Testing Video. Your User Testing ID will be
                compared to your Testing Video to ensure that the person who registered for the examination (and
                whose identity PPLingo has validated) is the same person who took the examination. Testing Video
                may also be used by our research team for examination validation and improvement purposes.

            <p class="registrationtitle">SHARING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</p>
            <p class="maintext">
                PPLingo shares your personally-identifiable information only when it is reasonably necessary to
                offer the Service, legally required, or permitted by you. For example:
                We may provide personally-identifiable information to service providers who help us bring you
                the Service, such as hosting the Service at a co-location facility or sending email updates. In
                connection with these operations, our service providers may have access to
                personally-identifiable information for a limited time. When we utilize service providers for
                processing any personally-identifiable information, we implement reasonable contractual
                protections limiting the use of that personally-identifiable information to the provision of
                services to PPLingo.
                We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information in response to lawful
                requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.
                Additionally, we may share account or other personally-identifiable information when we believe
                it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or
                other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the PPLingo name, or to prevent
                imminent harm. This may include sharing personally-identifiable information with other
                companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
                PPLingo will share the complete and accurate results of PPLingo s with such institutions,
                including universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, “Score
                Recipients”) as you specify when you finish an examination. We will never share examination
                results with any party without your direction, except that anonymized examination results may be
                used by PPLingo and its partners to improve the examination and for research and analysis. We
                will not share your Testing ID with any Score Recipients, except with your consent upon
                initiation of a dispute by a Score Recipient.
                If the ownership of all or substantially all of the PPLingo business, or individual business
                units or assets owned by PPLingo that are related to the Service, were to change, your
                personally-identifiable information may be transferred to the new owner. In any such transfer of
                information, your personally-identifiable information would remain subject to this section.

            <p class="registrationtitle">UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p>
            <p class="maintext">
                You have at all times the right to delete your account with PPLingo by following the
                instructions available through the Service. After your account is deleted we will retain
                aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Service, including Activity Data, which may be
                used by PPLingo and shared with third parties in any manner. Information associated with the
                PPLingo , including examination results and your Testing Video, may be collectively deleted from
                your PPLingo account, but anonymized examination data, including your examination results and
                Testing Video, may be kept indefinitely by PPLingo to improve the examination and for research
                and analysis.

                The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy
                practices of other websites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read
                the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. This
                Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by PPLingo via the Service.

            <p class="maintext">
                PPLingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are sufficient to
                protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your Testing ID, User Photo, access
                credentials and PPLingo results. However, we believe that a determined attacker with sufficient
                resources could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the information we
                seek to protect.
